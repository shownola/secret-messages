# README
* This app will be written with JavaScript and HTML. I will be using the Materialize framework for styling.
* This will be a small messaging app to share private messages between friends.
* Show a simple form on the front page where you can enter a message.
* Add an eventListener for the form to watch for a submit event.
* After the submit update the HTML to show a 'share link with a friend' text along with a link.
* Encrypt the message using Base64 Encoding.
